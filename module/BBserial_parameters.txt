Templates
	Bus5							-	contains all PCI templates.
		ComBaseAddressAlignment		-	always 8 for UART COM ports. This value has only got to be there,
										when nComPorts is not 0.
		LptBaseAddressAlignment		-	always 4 for UART LPT ports. This value has only got to be there,
										when nLptPorts is not 0.
		ClockFrequency				-	clock frequency in Hz
		ClockFrequencyAdjustment	-	value which adjusts the clock frequency by dividing or
										multiplying with the given value. Default is 1, which
										does not chage the clock frequency. If the value is 0,
										the driver defaults it to 1. Any other positive value
										is the multiplyer for the clock frequency. Any other
										negative value is made positive, and then the clock
										frequency gets divided by this value.
		Description			- 	Whatever you want call it (For example "Steve")
		DeviceID			-	Device ID of the card, including the correct Revision ID
		nComPorts			-	Number of COM ports on the card
		nLptPorts			-	Number of LPT ports on the card
		VendorID			-	...

		PlxBaudClockType	-	If a card contains a Baud Clock register on the PLX chip, 
								then this value has to be set. Possible values are :
									0	-	no Baud Clock is on the card. This causes the 
											following two Plx.. values to be ignored.
									1	-	Baud Clock as i.e. on cards with device ID 42, 81, 
											101, 121 or 161 ...
									2	-	Baud Clock as i.e. on cards with device ID E1 ...
									3	-	Baud Clock as i.e. on cards with device ID A0 ...
									4	-	ISA only
									5	-	PCMCIA only
									6	-	PCI only
									7	-	PCMCIA only
									8	-	PCI - Similar to 3, only for 4 ports.
									9	-	PCI as i.e. on cards with device ID 280.
								For 1 and 2, PlxBaudClockDivisor and PlxBaudClockOffset have 
								to be present. For 3, only PlxBaudClockDivisor has to be 
								there. In addition to this the values DuplexOperation and 
								CtsTrue have to be present for 3.
								For all except 0, MaximumBaudrate must be present.
		PlxBaudClockDivisor	-	Gives the divisor which should be selected by default. Possible
								values are : 1, 2, 4 and 8.
		PlxBaudClockOffset	-	Gives the offset for the PLX register(s) from the beginning of
								the PLX chip address range in I/O space.
		MaximumBaudrate		-	The maximum baudrate which the card supports by specification.
		DuplexOperation		-	0	-	RS485 half-duplex autogating mode
								1	-	RS485 half-duplex Rx/Tx state set by RTS line
								4	-	Tx and Rx both disabled
								5	-	Tx enabled, Rx disabled (RS485 half-duplex manual)
								6	-	Tx disabled, Rx enabled (RS485 half-duplex manual)
								7	-	full-duplex
		CtsTrue				-	If 0, CTS reflects the state of the CTS line receiver.
								If 1, CTS is held TRUE
		RxTriggerLevel	-	Receive Trigger Level for 950 chips. (not yet implemented) Range 1-100
							As an extra feature, if both, RxTriggerLevel and TxTriggerLevel, are 
							set to 0, the FIFOs are disabled. If the value is not there, the default
							is set to 100 by the driver.
		TxTriggerLevel	-	Transmit Trigger Level for 950 chips. (not yet implemented) Range 1-100
							As an extra feature, if both, RxTriggerLevel and TxTriggerLevel, are 
							set to 0, the FIFOs are disabled. If the value is not there, the default
							is set to 1 by the driver. 
		SoftTxLimit		-	The amount of characters transmitted on each TX empty interrupt 
							in percent. The allowed range is 1 to 100. Setting it to 1 garanties
							that only 1 byte at a time is written to the FIFO. Setting it to 100 
							garanties, that the FIFO is filled up to its maximum on transmit.
							The default, if the value is not present in, is 100.
		UartType		-	This value should normally not be there. The Control Panel does
							not need to update this value. It only exists for debugging purposes,
							to overwrite the UART class to be installed on a port. For example :
							when the card has 950 on it. Setting this value to 5, forces the 
							driver to use only 550 support. Possible value are :
							4	-	450 UART
							5	-	550	UART
							7	-	750 UART
							9	-	950 UART
		AlwaysUsePortSpaceAccess  -		If this value is set to 1, the port driver is forced to
										access the card through port address space, no matter if
										the card would support memory space access. Nothing can overwirte
										this value, when set to 1. If it is not 1, it is ignored.




Parameters					-	contains all parameter informationfor the cards
	Bus5					-	contains all PCI parameters
		CardX				-	contains all parameters for 1 card. The card keys must be consecutive 
								order, based on 1
			DeviceID		-	Device ID of the card, including the correct Revision ID
			VendorID		-	...
			nBus			- 	Bus number where the device was found. The information is transferred

			PlxBaudClockDivisor	-	Gives the divisor values for the PLX Baud Clock. This value
									overwrites the Templates setting. Possible values are : 1, 2, 
									4 and 8. This Baud Clock Divisor can only be present for cards

									card with other than 750 or 950 chips. On 750 or 950 cards, the default
